# OWASP-Risk-Calculator

## Introduction
A Simple Website to calculate your Risk score using some basic factors guided by OWASP. 
This OWASP Risk Calculator is a tool designed to help us assess potential security risks based on a set of simple questions. The calculated risk is presented through a bar chart using Chart.js for a visual representation. The factors taken into account are outlined below.

## Factors

### 1. Threat Agent Factors

Describe the questions and considerations involved in the threat agent factor. Discuss potential threats and actors that could pose risks to the company.

### 2. Vulnerability Factors

Outline the questions and factors for vulnerability assessment. Highlight areas where the system may be susceptible to exploitation.

### 3. Technical Impact Factors

Elaborate on the questions and criteria for technical impact assessment. Consider the potential impact on the technology and infrastructure in case of a security breach.

### 4. Business Impact Factors

Explain the questions and considerations for business impact assessment. Discuss how security incidents may affect the overall business operations and reputation.
